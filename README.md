# SciKit-Learn classification models and Optimization methods
By August Semrau Andersen.

This project is an entry into the Kaggle competition 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster'.  
The goal of the competition is a binary classification task of predicting which passengers of the Titanic survived the infamous disaster.

The intent with the project is to display proficiency in using the SciKit-Learn package for a classification task.  
Further ability in tuning of models using Bayesian Optimization is also displayed.


### Scripts
The following scripts are used for completing the competition.
 
1. dataLoader.py which loads .csv data and uses scikit-learn (sklearn) for preprocessing. 
2. models.py contains some non-tuned sklearn classification models, some tuned models and an XGBoost classifier.
3. predictions.py is used for printing predictions to .csv format for entry in Kaggle-competition.
4. bayesian_optimization.py has been used for tuning hyper-parameters of the Random Forest classifier using Bayesian Optimization strategy.
5. knn_tuning.py uses k-fold cross-validation and tries to find the optimal number of neighbors in the K-Nearest-Neighbors model.
6. xgb_tuning.py is used for tuning the XGBoost classifier.


### Models and their Accuracy
Below is a short description of each model used and which accuracy they yielded.

- Random Forest, no tuning: 0.766 accuracy.  
Random Forest, BO tuned: 0.778 accuracy. <- Best.

- Baseline (guessing): ~0.5 accuracy.

- Logistic Regression, no tuning: 0.758 accuracy.

- Naive Bayes, no tuning: 0.718 accuracy.

- Stochastic Gradient Descent, squared_loss: 0.373 accuracy.
This is obviously faulty.
The explanation in this case seems that SDG guesses a lot of 1'es (alive) while there are an overload of 0'es (diseased).

- K-Nearest-Neighbors, K=10: 0.634 accuracy  
I tried to find optimal number of K but they were all equally bad.

- Decision Tree, no tuning: 0.722 accuracy.

- Support Vector Machine, no tuning: 0.773 accuracy.

- XGBoost, no tuning: 0.775 accuracy.


Final rank on Kaggle: 7770, top 30 %.
